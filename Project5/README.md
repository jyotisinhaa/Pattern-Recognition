# Generative Models

A trend in deep learning is developing generative machine learning models that can make the predictions explainable and accountable. In this, I will train several classic generative models-- restricted Boltzmann machine, Variational auto-encoder and generative adversarial networks using Tensorflow/Keras to generate MNIST images.

   1) Derive the restricted Bolzmann machine algorithm with 20, 100 and 500 hidden nodes to generate MNIST images using the training data set.
   2)Derive the variational autoencoder algorithm with 2, 8 and 16 code units to encode MNIST images using the training data set.
   3)Implement VAE to generate MNIST images,where I used convolutional neural network from encoder and deconvolutional neural network for decoder.
   4) Derive the GAN algorithm and train it from MNIST training data set to generate digits.Show the images generated from GAN.
